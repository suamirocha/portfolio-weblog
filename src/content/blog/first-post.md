My journey in programming began when I watched the dorama Start Up, also known as Apostando Alto, which explores the entrepreneurial path in the world of technology. The story revolves around a struggling family, where the father seeks support for his software project in a start-up. Unfortunately, his project is rejected, and he suffers a stroke on the bus on his way back home.

This event sparked in me the desire to immerse myself in the world of technology and help others. The daughter decides to take the reins and start her own start-up, driven by the dream of making a difference. Throughout the dorama, we witness the development of this start-up through a hackathon and the real challenges faced to help the community. This story caught my attention and made me reflect on why I didn't choose this field earlier, as it seems so aligned with who I am.

The next day, I made the decision to enroll at Centro Universit√°rio Internacional UNINTER, and since then, I haven't stopped studying programming. My ultimate goal is to create software that benefits the community and brings a positive impact to people's lives.

When I was a child, I had the opportunity to play with those big and heavy computers. It was fun spending hours drawing on Paint and playing classic Windows games like chess and solitaire. At that time, I wasn't very connected to technology because I came from a humble family and had limited exposure to it. However, looking back, I realize that I had a natural aptitude for learning new features.

Another joyful memory is my passion for tinkering with Nokia cellphones. When I discovered that I could also become a mobile developer, my eyes lit up with happiness. This idea sparked a unique enthusiasm within me because I could create applications and explore the full potential of mobile devices.
